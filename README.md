# 1. ISI_SixSigma_With_Business_Analytics_2018_2024

I have successfully completed the Six Sigma Green and Black Belt with Business Analytics certification programs from the Indian Statistical Institute in Hyderabad. As part of my coursework, I collaborated with employers on two projects. The course assignment, exams and project reports are available in this GitHub repository for reference.


# 2. Open Source Contribution

I'm actively involved in contributing to the open-source project py-datatable, a data wrangling library funded by h2o.ai. 

Here's how I'm helping the community:

  **Feature Requests and Bug Reports:** I propose new features and report bugs I encounter on the project's GitHub repository.

  **Documentation Development:** I contribute to expanding and improving the documentation for py-datatable, ensuring clear instructions for users.

  **Community Support:** I actively participate in the py-datatable community by responding to issues and answering questions on Stack Overflow and the GitHub discussions forum.

I'm a dedicated contributor to the py-datatable community. Having leveraged its capabilities for efficient large-scale data handling, I've authored a series of Jupyter Notebooks to guide others in getting started with py-datatable in Python.
